This interview was for Computer Scientist -1 role, though I didn't knew as I was expecting cs2 based on my experience . There were a total of 5 rounds for me including one Hiring Manager and HR round.

Recriuter screening (~20 minutes ) :

The Recruiter called me and explained about the role and tech stack required for the role . She also explained the entire interview process. She asked for some details and few behaviour questions like why Adobe etc.
The first two rounds were supposed to happen on first day followed by two other rounds. Finally she scheduled the intereviews.

Round 1( ~70 minutes ):

This was a pure Javascript and web development round. The interviewer was a cs2 and very kind and humble.

We started with HTML5 , css3 , ES5 concepts and went very deeper to concepts like
async | defer . How a web page is rendered in UI (lifecycles).

Then there were few output based questions covering various JS topics like hoisting , deep clone compostion , currying etc.
Then few problem solving questions like writing polyfill for promise.allSettled arr.map .

I was surprised no DS Algo questions were asked. Overall this round went well. I got stuck in few problems but the interviewer helped me.

Round - 2 ( ~ 80 mins ):

This round was purely problem solving round and went really well for me. The interviwer was another CS1. Total 4 questions were asked. I couldn't find them on Leetcode.

Q1 . Design a class which supports method chaining based on a requirement.

          e.g   `obj.test(2).method2().print()`
Q2. Design a class which acts like producer-consumer. Producer will submit messages , consumers should listen and print the message. Initially I struggled to understand the ask but then wrote a class to simulate it.

    // producer 
    
   const producer = new Producer();
   producer.send('chat',{message: "hi"});
   
   // consumer 
   
   const consumer = new Consumer();
  	consumer.subscribe('chat',(msg)=>{
  	    console.log("msg : ",msg);
  	})
   
followup :
We should be able to cancel the subscription by calling a method cancelSubscription(id) .
Implemented a hashmap to maintain the list and do the needful.

Q3 : This was a LC medium question on dp. Based on https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/

Q4. It was 2 sum problem with a twist that you're not supposed to use extra space.

Round 3 (~60 mins):

This round was with Senior Computer Scientist. It was supposed to be a design + React round.

Q1. Design a game app.

Q2. I was asked to implement UI part of the game. No logic was expected but the UI should be there. I had option to choose any framework of my choice.

Q3. General questions about performance techniques , i18n etc.

Overall this round went really well.

Round - 4: HM round

Mostly asked questions related to current role and projects. Also involved behavioural questions. After that, he asked a coding questions in vanilla js :

Q1. Implement a UI widget using vanilla js.

I did it very quickly. Then he went on and explained about the product and expectations.

Received the call next day that I have been selected and they are moving ahead with the offer. Whole process took ~4 weeks time.
